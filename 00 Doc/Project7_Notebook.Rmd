##  Our Datasets

> We used one dataset that contains the information of the top 5000 fastest growing companies in the United States:  [Inc.5000 2016: The Full List](https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2016/).
> Download the dataset from [here](https://data.world/albert/inc-5000-2016-the-full-list/file/inc5000_2016.csv).
> Another data that we used to join the previous one is the US Census Income data [US Census population estimates, Income (American Community Survey, 2011-2015)](https://data.world/uscensusbureau/acs-2015-5-e-income)
> Download the dataset from [here](https://data.world/uscensusbureau/acs-2015-5-e-income/file/USA_All_States.csv)
> The former includes growth rate, rank, and annual revenue of the fastest growing companies in the US. The latter primarily documents the number of households belong in different levels of income. Therefore, we joined these two datasets together by states in order to find interesting  visualizations using Barchats in tableau and implement the visualizations using the Shiny app and the ggplot.

```

##  Methodology
   > 1. Our dataset comes from [Inc. 5000 2016: The Full List](https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2016/) and [US Census population estimates, Income (American Community Survey, 2011-2015)](https://data.world/uscensusbureau/acs-2015-5-e-income)
   > 2. Cleaning the datasets by following steps:
 
       i. Create an ETL script to clean up the Inc. 5000 dataset.
       ii. Run a query to select and combine columns we need from the census dataset on data.world and export it. 
       iii. Upload the cleaned up company dataset and the census income dataset as csv files to data.world.
   >3. Use Tableau's web data connector to import the datasets. Join the two datasets together by State to merge the datasets for exploration. 
       
       i. Create Barcharts with one dimension and one measure at first
       ii. Create sets by selecting top 5 revenue state, top 5 revenue industry, and top fastest growth companies by their ID. 
       iii. Use sets as filters and add additional dimensions to creat interesting barcharts.
   >4. We had to set the "S17 DV Project 6" data.world datasets PUBLIC in order to access and work on it in RStudio when we wrote the server code.
   >5. Write SQL and R SDK in order to create the same Barcharts with ggplot. 
   >6. Create the Shiny App which includes all the three visualizations, and publish it onto the Shiny server.
   
   
> This is the dataset after the cleaning process:

```{r, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5} 
source("../01 Data/ETL_working.R")
```


##  Visualizations
Visualizations were created using both Tableau and R Shiny. 

### Shiny App
To view the Shiny web app we made for the project, click this [link](https://ronzhang.shinyapps.io/project6/).  

###  Figure 1
![](../03 Visualizations/Average growth for 5 highest revenue state by industry.png)

> **Insight for Figure 1: *Average growth rate in states for different industry* **  
This barchart displays the average growth rate in selected states for selected industry. The states selected are the top 5 states which has the highest sum revenue during 2015. The industry set used as filter includes the 6 industries which has the highest sum revenue in 2015. The horizontal bars represent the average growth rates for the specific industry in individual states. The window reference line is the average of the average growth rate for the industry in selectedstates.

> From the barchart we see that in Business product and services industry, state Georgia is growing fast, because its average growth rate is extremely higher than other states??. In Construction industry, California is playing the leading role. And in Human Resources industry, Florida shows the fastest growth. However, for Health industry, there is no obvious leading state; all states developed it well during year2015. 



### Figure 2
![](../03 Visualizations/High Revenue ID Sets on Growth.png)

> **Insight for Figure 2: *High revenue ID set on Growth* **  
We create a ID Set using company id and its revenue. We select companies whose revenue greater than 10 billion as high revenue companies, and there are 19 of them. The bar chart displays the growth rate for these 19 companies. 

> Among these 19 companies with highest revenue, only two companies?? growth rate exceeds the average growth rate across the total 5000 companies.


### Figure 3
![](../03 Visualizations/Average revenue for 5 highest revenue state by yrs on list.png)

> **Insight for Figure 3: *Average revenue for 5 highest revenue state by yrs on list* **  
We first create a set of the five states with the highest revenue. For all the companies in these five states, we group them by years on the list. The bar chart shows the average revenue each group. We also calculate the difference between each bar and the average for the pane.

> In Texas, the longer companies stay on the list, the companies tend to have higher revenue. However, the extremes appear at the 9th year in Georgia and at 7th years in New York.
